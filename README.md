# Description

This project application is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. I used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.

---------
# Installations

The user should clone the repository from GitHub. This application requires Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize. To connect to the database run mysql -u root -p. Then source the schema.sql. To seed the file run npm run seed. Finally to connect to the server run npm start.
